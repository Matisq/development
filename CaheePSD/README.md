# About CaheePSD

**CaheePSD** layout was coded with PSD file available on [Weekly WebDev Challenge [PL FB GROUP]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/940002776068923/)
It was created by using languages like HTML5, CSS3 with Flexbox, Bootstrap framework and little Javascript for creating smooth scroll effect.

## What did I learn from the project?

* Bootstrap 4 - especially things about grid system(based on flexbox), using various classes to keep project responsive,
* CSS3 - overlays, transitions, animations, gradients, box-shadow and so on,
* SASS - 7x1 pattern to keep files more organized, basic things like variables, placeholders, mixins,
* Javascript / jQuery / Node.js / Gulp - how to animate scroll on the page when clicking links on the page (Smooth scroll),
how to compile SASS after saving it, what is Node.js and npm package manager, package.json file
